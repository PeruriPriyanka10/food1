            <b>Karnataka</b> has a diverse cuisine but the food in all is considered to be the mildest when it comes to spiciness. They use chilli, jaggery and palm sugar generously. Here the food has several subcategories-

             <ul><li><strong>North Karnataka Cuisine</strong> is mostly prepared with rice and millet. They also use a lot of spices and take a variety of chutneys and pickles with their food. </li></ul> 
             <ul><li><strong>Coastal Karnataka Cuisine</strong> is most seafood based. Chicken, Fish and Meat is essentially prepared in coconut oil and coconut curry and are served with rice which is the staple food. </li></ul>
             <ul><li><strong>Coorgi Cuisine </strong>is again very distinct. Pork is their favourite and most commonly used meat. They also use a lot of kokum in their food preparations.</li></ul> 
             <ul><li><strong>South Karnataka Cuisine </strong>is also known as the Old Mysore Cuisine where the stable food is rice and millets. The curries are thick and sweet and sour and are served with steamed rice. Mysore Pak is a popular specialty of the place.</li></ul></p>

            <p >Bisi Bele Bhaat is a traditional Karnataka dish. It is made when steamed rice is cooked together with toor daal, vegetables and spices. It is a regional counterpart of north Indian “khichdi”. The dish is best served with boondi raita, chutney, salad, papad or potato/ banana chips. It is a part of the Udipi cuisine.</p> 
            <h2 style="color:rgb(145, 63, 221)">2.Masala Dosa</h2> 
            <img src="https://img.traveltriangle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Masala-Dosa-400x229.jpg" width="500"/>
            <p >Originating from the state of Karnataka, this dish is probably the most iconic and is one of the most <strong>famous foods of south India </strong>which can be found in all the corners of the country. Almost everyone has tasted Masala dosa once, which is made from cooking the batter of rice and lentils which was soaked overnight for fermentation. It is generally served along with a coconut chutney and sambar. Owing to its popularity, there are cultural variations in the recipe of dosa giving us a variety of dosas such as paper masala dosa, Mysore masala dosa, Madras special masala dosa etc.</p>
