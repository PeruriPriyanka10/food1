            <p>Telugu and Andhra food is the spiciest amongst all cuisines. They use tamarind and chilli generously, hence, making the food really hot and tangy.

Other popular items include pesarattu (mung bean pancake), pulihaara (tamarind and lemon rice), thotakura (amaranth–pigeon pea stew) pappu, dosakaya (yellow cucumber – pigeon pea stew), sakinalu, rawa laddu etc.</p>
